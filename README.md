# DiaLife

A tiny demo project to showcase Clean Architecture, MVVM, Room interaction and dependency injection (via Koin).

This simple demo app lets the user add "diary entries" consisting of a single line of text, and remove said lines of text again.

The backend can be Room db storage, or in-memory storage with or without predefined elements.


Too change data backend, change which line is commented out in MainActivity.onCreate, lines 91-93.
